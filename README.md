The Strange Case...
===================

It's yet another static site generator.  Have you seen jekyll?  hyde?  Yup.  Like those.

But this one is:

1. Written in python, unlike `jekyll`
2. **NOT** complicated, unlike `hyde`.  and I mean *really* **NOT** complicated.


OK, SO
-------

* `config.yaml` stores context variables.
* `site/` stores site content - templates and assets.  These are processed or copied or ignored, as the case may be.
* `config.yaml` files in a folder within `site/` override settings in the parent folder.  config is merged with the default config (see below - it's simple, too!).
* `./` is the "root" afa template includes go:
  * layouts can go in `layouts/` and are extended using `{% extends 'layouts/file.j2' %}`
  * includes can go in `anywhere/` and are included using `{% include 'anywhere/file.j2' %}`
  * see? only `site/` is special.  everything else is up to you.


DEFAULT CONFIG
--------------

'host': hostname (http://localhost:8000)
'ignore': which files to ignore altogether (['config.yaml', '.*'])
'dont_process': do not run these files through jinja (['*.js', '*.css', *images])
'rename_extensions': which extensions to rename ({'j2': 'html'})


EXECUTING
---------

`$ python strange_case.py`

Goes through all the files and directories in site/

* Folders become "FolderNode" objects (site/ is such a node).  folders have children
* Templates (jinja2 templates - or any text file) become TemplatePageNode(PageNode) objects
* Assets (css, js, images - anything that isn't a template) become AssetPageNode(PageNode) objects


Files can have metadata either as front matter, or in that folder's config.yaml in the parent folder, in a "files" entry (this is so that static assets can have metadata).  because of this, "files:" in the yaml files are not copied as context variables.


These nodes are placed in a tree:

    (root, aka site)
    | static/
    | | css/
    | | + style.css
    | \ image/
    |   | img1.png
    |   | img2.png
    |   + img3.png
    | robots.txt
    | index (index.j2 => index.html)
    \ blogs/
      | test1 (test1.j2 => test1.html)
      + test2 (test2.j2 => test2.html)


TEMPLATES
---------

### In your templates, you have access anything in the top-level config and in per-page metadata:

`/config.yaml`:

``` yaml
meta:
  author:
    name: Colin
```

`/site/index.html`:

``` jinja
---
# front matter
title: test
---

{{ meta.author.name }}
{{ title }}
```

=>

    Colin
    test


### You can iterate over folders:

``` jinja
{% for blog in site.blogs %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ blog.title }}
{% endfor %}
```

### Or access a page by name (filename w/o ext):

``` jinja
{{ site.blogs.test1.url }}
```

### Iterate over static assets:

``` jinja
{% for image in site.static.image %}
<img src="{{ image.url }}" />
{% endfor %}
```

AND THAT'S IT
-------------

jinja2 makes it easy to put logic in these templates, which is really the only place for them...

...or is it !?  Iâ€™m wondering what kind of spaghetti nonsense these templates could end up with (it's like PHP all over again!), and how that could be fixed.


TODO
----

* Add page processors, so that you could build a categories index page based on pages' category metadata.
* Placing entries in .../config.yaml override parent configs, but i'd like to add a merging syntax similar to what we have in fbmvc (`key ?:`, `key !:`, `key -:` ...)
